# Sandwich Blog is 10/10

This is a Gatsby static site deployed to Netlify with Wordpress as the CMS.

The wordpress instance is hosted on Digital Ocean, and all post saves/creates trigger a fresh deployment through Netlify with the most up to date content.

I'm excited about the stack and the seamless deployments, but I have put very little effort into visuals of the Site itself... yet.
